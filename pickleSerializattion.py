"""
Pickle Module: It is another way to serialize and deserialize Python objects.
It serializes the Python object in a binary format, due to which it is not human-readable. 
It is faster and it also works with custom-defined objects. 
The Python pickle module is a better choice for serialization and deserialization of python objects.
If you donâ€™t need a human-readable format or if you need to serialize custom objects then it is recommended to use the pickle module.
